# tts

Text-to-speech service for ODS (powered by Kokoro)

## Overview

The TTS service provides high-quality neural text-to-speech synthesis using [Kokoro FastAPI](https://github.com/remsky/kokoro-fastapi), a fast and lightweight TTS server with an OpenAI-compatible API. It is used by Open WebUI to read AI responses aloud and can be called directly from any application that supports the OpenAI Audio Speech endpoint.

## Features

- **OpenAI-compatible API**: Drop-in replacement for `POST /v1/audio/speech`
- **Multiple voices**: Multiple voice presets available; default is `af_heart`
- **Concurrent requests**: 2 Uvicorn workers for parallel synthesis
- **Low latency**: CPU-based inference with fast Kokoro neural TTS model
- **OpenAI format**: Compatible with any client that uses `openai.audio.speech.create()`

## Configuration

Environment variables (set in `.env`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TTS_PORT` | `8880` | External port (maps to internal 8880) |
| `DEFAULT_VOICE` | `af_heart` | Default voice preset |
| `UVICORN_WORKERS` | `2` | Number of worker processes |

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check |
| `POST` | `/v1/audio/speech` | Synthesize speech from text (OpenAI format) |
| `GET` | `/v1/models` | List available TTS models |
| `GET` | `/v1/voices` | List available voice presets |

### CLI speech files

The shared Linux/WSL CLI can list voices and create a WAV file without an SDK:

```bash
ods tts voices
ods tts speak 'Hello from ODS.' greeting.wav --voice af_heart
printf 'Read this local report.\n' | ods tts speak - report.wav
```

Enable the `tts` service first. The CLI reads quoted `TTS_PORT` from the installed
`.env`, sends text only to the loopback Kokoro endpoint, and preserves paths
relative to the caller's directory. It does not play audio or start the service.
`--voice` defaults to `af_heart` and accepts voice combinations supported by Kokoro.
Text is limited to 10,000 characters and responses to 64 MiB; the HTTP socket
timeout is five minutes. The client requests Kokoro's 24 kHz mono 16-bit PCM and
writes a complete WAV header locally: the shipped v0.2.4 WAV writer does not
finalize its header correctly. HTTP errors, redirects, unexpected content types,
empty audio, incomplete HTTP bodies or partial samples fail visibly without
publishing an output file.

The output must be a new path in an existing directory. Completed WAV files are
published atomically without replacing another writer's file, using a same-directory
hard link (the destination filesystem must support hard links). Files are private
to the invoking user by default. This command requires Python 3; the separately
generated native macOS installer CLI does not gain these subcommands.

### Example

```bash
curl http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "kokoro", "input": "Hello, welcome to ODS!", "voice": "af_heart"}' \
  --output speech.mp3
```

### Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8880/v1",
    api_key="not-needed"
)

response = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="kokoro",
    voice="af_heart",
    input="Hello from ODS!"
)
response.stream_to_file("output.mp3")
```

## Open WebUI Integration

Open WebUI is pre-configured to use this service:

```
AUDIO_TTS_ENGINE=openai
AUDIO_TTS_OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=http://tts:8880/v1
AUDIO_TTS_MODEL=kokoro
AUDIO_TTS_VOICE=af_heart
```

These values are set in `docker-compose.base.yml` and require no manual configuration.

## Files

- `compose.yaml` — Service definition
- `manifest.yaml` — Service metadata

## Troubleshooting

**Service not starting:**
```bash
docker compose ps tts
docker compose logs tts
```

**No audio output in Open WebUI:**
- Verify TTS is running: `curl http://localhost:8880/health`
- Check browser audio permissions and output device

**Slow synthesis:**
- The CPU image processes speech on CPU; synthesis takes 1–5 seconds depending on text length
- Ensure the container has sufficient CPU allocation (`TTS_CPU_LIMIT` in `.env`; the installer auto-caps it to Docker's visible CPU count)

**Wrong voice:**
- List available voices: `curl http://localhost:8880/v1/voices`
- Change `DEFAULT_VOICE` in `.env` or specify `voice` per-request
